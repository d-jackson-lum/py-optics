# py-optics
Python code to aid with calculations for nanophotonics. Currently it contains:
- fast_psf_calc: code that calculates the point spread function (electromagnetic field distribution) of a focused laser beam with arbitrary wavefront. The code takes polarization into account
- mie_calc: code that calculates the electromagnetic field distribution of a spherical particle at an arbitrary distance relative to a focused laser

All code is developed in-house at LUMICKS.
